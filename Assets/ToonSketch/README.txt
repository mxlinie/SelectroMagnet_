ToonSketch is a non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) asset pack for use in creating graphical styles
inspired by animation, comics, and other artistic mediums.
The set comprises two key shaders; a material shader which supports toon shading with customisable ramp texture and
crosshatched shading, along with post-processing shaders which are used in conjunction with a camera component to render image effects.
The material shader builds on Unity's standard surface shader library and so fully supports dynamic and baked lighting,
global illumination, and ambient/vertex/spherical harmonics.

Demo::
There are demo assets under "ToonSketch/Demo" and a scene which can be used as example of how to use the effects.
There are also a number of core textures in "ToonSketch/Core/Textures/Effects" such as hatch textures, ramp textures,
LUT textures, and canvas textures.
